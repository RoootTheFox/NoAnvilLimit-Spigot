# NoAnvilLimit-Spigot
The spigot plugin for NoAnvilLimit. Has a /rename command.<br>

**To use this with the mod you need to run a Spigot 1.17.1 server. Other version don't work because of NMS, thats why its disabled by default.**

You can enable and disable the /rename command as well as the anvil gui hack in the config file. (The anvil GUI hack only works on MC 1.17.1)

A lot of the code is kinda messy but it works ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
