# NoAnvilLimit-Spigot
The spigot plugin for NoAnvilLimit. Has a /rename command.<br>

<b>To use this with the mod, you'll need to run a Spigot/Paper/whatever 1.17.1 server. Other versions won't work because of NMS, thats why its disabled by default. You can enable it in the config file generated on first start. `(enableAnvilGUIHack)`</b>

You can enable and disable the /rename command as well as the anvil gui hack in the config file. (The anvil GUI hack only works on MC 1.17.1)

A lot of the code is kinda messy but it works ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**Requires ProtocolLib**
